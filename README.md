# vim-soul

This is [Vim][] syntax-highlighting plugin for the [SOUL][] programming language. Since
SOUL is in beta the syntax is a bit of a moving target, so don't be afraid to submit
issues if you notice something is off.

maintain your plugins:

1. Add the following to your `.vimrc`:
```vim
Plug 'gmoe/vim-soul'

   this plugin.

Or consider using Vim 8's [native plugin manager][vim8] and clone this repo
